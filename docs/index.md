## About myself
My name is Dominik Wiesend, I'm born in 1992, I had a wonderful childhood except of a very traumatic experience, I wasn't bad at school but I didn't liked it to be there, this was the reason for me to start my working career at an age of 15, I did an vocational training at Ziemann & Urban GmbH for becoming a IT systems electronics engineer, during the vocational training I found myself a new fervor for programming and coding, after my vocational training I leaved that company and became a new employee at BSH Hausger√§te GmbH, shortly after starting my work at the new company I found the wife of my dreams and we did become parents of a wonderful daughter and only a few years later we became a wonderful son too, since them I changed the position within the same company several times to come my wish work closer, being a awesome fulltime programmer.
